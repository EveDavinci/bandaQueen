          <summary>Death on Two Legs </summary>
         
  <p>You suck my blood like a leech<br>
    You break the law and you breach<br>
    Screw my brain till it hurts<br>
    You've taken all my money and you want more</p>
  
    <p>Misguided old mule<br>
    With your pig headed rules<br>
    With your narrow minded cronies<br>
    Who are fools of the first division</p>
  
    <p>Death on two legs<br>
    You're tearing me apart<br>
    Death on two legs<br>
    You've never had a heart of your own</p>
  
    <p>Kill joy<br>
    Bad guy<br>
    Big talking<br>
    Small fry</p>
  
    <p>You're just an old barrow boy<br>
    Have you found a new toy<br>
    To replace me?<br>
    Can you face me?</p>
  
    <p>But now you can kiss<br>
    My ass goodbye</p>
  
    <p>Feel good<br>
    Are you satisfied?<br>
    Do you feel like<br>
    Suicide? (I think you should)</p>
  
    <p>Is your conscience all right<br>
    Does it plague you at night?<br>
    Do you feel good?<br>
    Feel good?</p>
  
    <p>Talk like a big business tycoon<br>
    You're just a hot air balloon<br>
    So no one gives you a damn<br>
    You're just an overgrown schoolboy, let me tan your hide</p>
  
    <p>A dog with disease<br>
    You're the king of the sleaze<br>
    Put your money where your mouth is<br>
    Mr. Know-All, was the fin on your back part of the deal? Shark</p>
  
    <p>Death on two legs<br>
    You're tearing me apart<br>
    Death on two legs<br>
    You've never had a heart (you never did) of your own (right from the start)</p>
  
    <p>Insane<br>
    Should be put inside<br>
    You're a sewer rat<br>
    Decaying in a cesspool of pride</p>
  
    <p>Should be made unemployed<br>
    Make yourself null and void<br>
    Make me feel good<br>
    I feel good</p>

            <p>And the night followed day<br>
            And the story tellers say<br>
            That the score brave souls inside<br>

            Meanwhile<br>
            I ask you to be my Clementine</p>
            
            <p>You say you will if you could but you can't<br>
            I love you madly<br>

          <p>Oh, oh, people of the earth<br>
            "Listen to the warning,"<br>
            The seer he said<br>
            Beware the storm that gathers here<br>
            Listen to the wise man.</p>
            
            <p>I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair<br>
            Spreading his hands on the multitude there<br>
            A man who cried for a love gone stale<br>
            And ice cold hearts of charity bare.<br>
            I watched as fear took the old man's gaze<br>
            Hopes of the young in troubled graves<br>
            "I see no day," I heard him say<br>
            So grey is the face of every mortal.</p>
            
            <p>Oh, oh, people of the earth<br>

            For soon the cold of night will fall<br>
            Summoned by your own hand.</p>
            
            <p>Oh, oh, children of the land<br>

            Fly and find the new green bough<br>
            Return like the white dove.</p>
            
            <p>He told of death as a bone white haze<br>
            Taking the lost and the unloved babe<br>
            Late too late all the wretches run<br>
            These kings of beasts now counting their days.</p>

            Married his own his precious gain<br>

            They'll be running for to come<br>
            Running for to come out of the rain</p>
            
            <p>Oh, flee for your life<br>
            Who heed me not, let all your treasure make you<br>
            Oh, fear for your life<br>
            Deceive you not, the fires of hell will take you<br>
            Should death await you</p>

          <summary>Good Company</summary>
          <p>"Take good care of what you've got,"<br>
            My father said to me<br>
            As he puffed his pipe and Baby B<br>
            He dandled on his knee<br>
            "Don't fool with fools who'll turn away<br>
            Keep all good company."<br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</p>
            
            <p>Take care of those you call your own<br>
            And keep good company</p>
            
            <p>Soon I grew and happy too<br>
            My very good friends and me<br>
            We'd play all day with Sally J<br>
            The girl from number four<br>
            And very soon I begged her, "Won't you keep me company?"</p>
            
            <p>Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br>
            Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh</p>
            
            <p>Come marry me for evermore<br>
            We'll be good company</p>
            
            <p>Now marriage is an institution. Sure<br>
            My wife and I, our needs and nothing more<br>
            All my friends by a year<br>
            By and by disappear<br>
            But we're safe enough behind our door</p>
            
            <p>I flourished in my humble trade<br>
            My reputation grew<br>
            The work devoured my waking hours<br>
            But when my time was through<br>
            Reward of all my efforts: my own limited company</p>
            
            <p>I hardly noticed Sally as we parted company</p>
            
            <p>All through the years<br>
            In the end, it appears<br>
            There was never really anyone but me</p>
            
            <p>Now I'm old, I puff my pipe<br>
            But no one's there to see<br>
            I ponder on the lesson of my life's insanity</p>
            
            <p>Take care of those you call your own<br>
            And keep good company</p>

          <summary>Bohemian Rhapsody</summary>
          <p>Is this the real life?<br>
            Is this just fantasy?<br>
            Caught in a landslide<br>
            No escape from reality</p>
            
            <p>Open your eyes<br>
            Look up to the skies and see<br>
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
            Because I'm easy come, easy go<br>
            Little high, little low<br>
            Any way the wind blows<br>
            Doesn't really matter to me, to me</p>
            
            <p>Mama, just killed a man<br>
            Put a gun against his head<br>
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br>
            Mama, life had just begun<br>
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away</p>
            
            <p>Mama, ooh<br>
            Didn't mean to make you cry<br>
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
            Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters</p>
            
            <p>Too late, my time has come<br>
            Sends shivers down my spine<br>
            Body's aching all the time<br>
            Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go<br>
            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth</p>
            
            <p>Mama, ooh (Any way the wind blows)<br>
            I don't wanna die<br>
            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all</p>
            
            <p>I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
            Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?<br>
            Thunderbolt and lightning very, very frightening me<br>

            <p>I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me<br>
            He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br>
            Spare him his life from this monstrosity</p>
            
            <p>Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?<br>
            Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (Let him go!)<br>
            Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go!)<br>
            Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let me go!)<br>
            Will not let you go (Let me go!)<br>
            Never let you go (Never, never, never, never let me go)<br>
            Oh oh oh oh<br>
            No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br>
            Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia (Mamma mia, let me go)<br>
            Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me</p>
            
            <p>So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br>
            So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br>
            Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby<br>
            Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here</p>

            Anyone can see<br>
            Nothing really matters<br>
            Nothing really matters to me</p>
